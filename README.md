# Chalmers Course Statistics
This is a simple web app for viewing grade statistics of courses at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://chalmers.se).

The data is provided by Chalmers via a public [Excel document](http://document.chalmers.se/doc/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00001C968DC6) which lists **all** the results of **all** courses...

## Credits
This app was created by [Jan Liu](https://github.com/fsharpasharp/) who was inspired by Johan Bowald's [exam statistics page](http://tenta.bowald.se). With the help of [Johan Winther](https://github.com/JohanWinther) the app was ported over to Fysikteknologsektionen's website ([ftek.se/stats](https://ftek.se/stats)).
